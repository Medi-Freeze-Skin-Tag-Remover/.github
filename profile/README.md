While they don't require medical treatment, many people seek ways to remove them for cosmetic reasons.

The Medi Freeze Skin Tag Remover is a cryogenic treatment that uses extremely cold temperatures to freeze and remove skin tags. It comes in the form of a small, handheld device that dispenses a precise amount of cryogenic gas onto the skin tag. This freezing action causes the skin tag to fall off within a few days, leaving behind smooth, healthy skin.

## How Does Medi Freeze Skin Tag Remover Work?

The Medi Freeze Skin Tag Remover works by a process called cryotherapy. When the cryogenic gas is applied to the skin tag, it causes the cells in the tag to freeze and crystallize. This freezing action damages the cells and cuts off the blood supply to the skin tag, causing it to die and eventually fall off.

The cryogenic gas used in the Medi Freeze Skin Tag Remover is dimethyl ether, a non-toxic and environmentally friendly substance that is commonly used in many household products. When applied to the skin, it quickly evaporates, leaving no residue or harmful chemicals behind.

No scarring: When used correctly, the Medi Freeze Skin Tag Remover should not leave any scarring or permanent marks on the skin.

## Active Ingredients

Thoroughly clean the area around the skin tag with soap and water, and dry it completely.
Shake the Medi Freeze Skin Tag Remover can well before use.
Hold the can upright and position the nozzle about 1⁄2 inch away from the skin tag.
Depress the nozzle for 2-3 seconds to release a short burst of cryogenic gas onto the skin tag.

Repeat the application if necessary, but avoid over-freezing the area.
The skin tag should fall off within 7-10 days after treatment.
